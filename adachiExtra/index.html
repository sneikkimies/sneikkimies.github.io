Shimamura: Sociability. Often, they're the head of the classroom.
Adachi: A unique name, I guess.

Q2 - What does one need to feel happy?
S: A bed. A kotatsu is nice to have too, but having a bed is the most important.
A: Shima-- Time to idle, or something.

Q3 - Do you have a person in your life you always feel safe around?
S: Hmm... My family, I guess?
A: Shima-- Shimamura.

Q4 - You are trapped in a room underground against your will. With you there are boys and girls of your own age. One day, one of your captors gives you a knife and says that if you kill one of the people trapped with you, they will let you go.
Your options are a boy who you're good friends with, your beautiful mother, and a cute girl you've not seen before.
Who do you kill to get out?
S: Hmm... I'd probably let the other people decide. Yeah, I think I'd do that.
A: My mother, probably.

Q5 - A girl with hair that glows, a weirdo girl who wears a helmet and is a bit goofy, or a girl who's tall and slender.
Which one of these do you choose?
S: Well, I'm a girl myself, but I'd probably go with the tall one.
A: None.

Q6 - How much of a prince are you?
S: Again, like I told you, I'm a girl.
A: I'd rather be a princess, personally.

Q7 - What do you think is the suitable maximum age difference between lovers?
S: I haven't thought about that, but I think I'd be scared to go out with someone older than myself.
A: I think it's best if there isn't any.

Q8 - If you were to write a novel, what sort of novel would it be?
S: The Mystery of a Doughnut That Vanished Yesterday.
A: Shima-- It'd be about becoming friends.

Q9 - You are a 24-year-old university student. You don't have any money. What do you do?
S: Get a job.
A: Get a job.

Q10 - You find yourself having fallen in love with a certain girl. What do you do?
S: Umm, why is Adachi acting all weird?
A: *Panicking*.

Q11 - Someone comes in and steals your favourite food that you were saving to eat last. What do you do?
S: Tell them that I would've given it to them if they'd asked, so next time, they should just ask.
A: Start eating it first from then on.

Q12 - If the world rewound every time you died, what would you do?
S: Hmm... That's a tough one... Probably nothing special.
A: Ask Shimamura for advice.

Q13 - Describe your enthusiasm towards the next release in your series.
S: Next up would be Valentine's Day, right? Hmm... That doesn't really have anything to do with me, I don't think.
A: Ch-Chocolate?
